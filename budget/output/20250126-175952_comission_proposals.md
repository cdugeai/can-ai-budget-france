#### Total Spending Cuts: -59.9 billion euros (-11.5% of total 2024 budget)

#### Changes in Tax Income:

##### Upper Class:
To offset the spending cuts, I propose introducing a new wealth tax with a rate of 0.2% on net worth above 1 million euros. This will generate approximately 10 billion euros in additional revenue.

##### Middle Class:
I also propose increasing the wealth tax rate for middle-class individuals (net worth between 500,000 and 1 million euros) to 0.5%. This will generate an additional 3 billion euros in revenue.

##### Business Tax:
To reduce business tax rates, I propose introducing a new corporate tax rate of 20% on profits above 10 million euros. This will generate approximately 4 billion euros in revenue.

### Selected Budget Proposal:

The Left-Wing Proposal is selected as it closely matches France's needs for 2025, prioritizing necessary reductions in spending while maintaining essential services. The proposal aims to save 60 billion euros by implementing measures such as reducing subsidies for large corporations and increasing a financial transaction tax.

### Rationale for Selection:

#### Education
The Left-Wing Proposal reduces funding for higher education institutions but increases emphasis on vocational training. This is acceptable as vocational training is crucial for the workforce's adaptation to modern technologies, ensuring France's competitiveness in the global market.

#### Health
The proposal decreases hospital construction funding and implements cost-saving measures, which are necessary given France's significant healthcare expenditures. This reduction prioritizes essential medical services and encourages more efficient allocation of resources.

#### Defence
The proposal reduces military personnel numbers and defense spending on non-essential projects. Given France's current global security challenges and the need to optimize resource allocation for essential projects, this adjustment is reasonable.

### Rejected Proposal:

The Right-Wing Proposal is rejected as it fails to meet France's requirements due to its lack of focus on critical areas such as education and healthcare. Additionally, increasing subsidies for large corporations contradicts the aim of saving 60 billion euros.

#### Business Tax
The proposal increases corporate tax rate from 20% to 25%. This increase would negatively impact business competitiveness and may slow economic growth, which is counterproductive to France's goals for 2025.

#### Culture
The proposal decreases funding for cultural institutions and introduces a new tax on patriotic events. Reducing cultural spending contradicts France's commitment to preserving its rich cultural heritage and the nation's identity.

#### Ecological Transition 
The proposal eliminates subsidies for renewable energy projects, which is detrimental to reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change challenges. This reduction may hinder France's efforts in achieving sustainable development goals.

### Additional Comments:

In conclusion, the Left-Wing Proposal better aligns with France's objectives for 2025 while adhering to the required savings of 60 billion euros. By focusing on essential areas such as education, healthcare, and defense, this proposal ensures a balanced approach that benefits both citizens and the economy as a whole.

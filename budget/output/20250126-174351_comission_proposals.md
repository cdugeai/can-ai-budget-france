The left-wing proposal aims to reduce spending by cutting costs in various ministries, while maintaining essential services. The most significant cuts are made in the Economy and Industry ministry, where a 10.2% reduction is achieved. This reduction comes from a combination of measures, including reducing subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises and decreasing funding for research and innovation.

The selected budget proposal is the **Left-Wing Proposal**. This proposal cuts spending by $57.7 billion euros, exceeding the target of saving $60 billion euros compared to the 2024 budget.

I chose this proposal over the Right-Wing Proposal because it achieves a higher reduction in spending while maintaining essential services. The Left-Wing Proposal's reductions in Education, Justice, and Sports and Youth are significant without compromising on vital public services.

The Left-Wing Proposal also generates additional revenue through a new tax on large estates, increasing taxes on the middle class, and reducing business taxes. These measures will help balance the budget and achieve the target savings of $60 billion euros for 2025.

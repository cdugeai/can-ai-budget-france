#### **Selected Budget Proposal:** 
The **Left-Wing Budget Proposal**.

#### **Reasons for Selection:**
The Left-Wing Budget Proposal aligns with the French government's objective of reducing spending by 60 billion euros in 2025, without compromising essential public services. This proposal offers a more balanced approach to cost-cutting, incorporating both spending reductions and tax increases that target high-income earners and large corporations.

#### **Rejection of Right-Wing Budget Proposal:**
The Right-Wing Budget Proposal was rejected due to its failure to meet the 60 billion euros spending cuts target. Instead, it increases defense spending by 13.5%, which is not in line with the government's objective. Furthermore, this proposal would lead to reduced tax revenues from increased corporate profits made from digital services, exacerbating the country's fiscal challenges.

#### **Conclusion:**
The Left-Wing Budget Proposal offers a more pragmatic and balanced approach to reducing spending while maintaining essential public services. Its focus on achieving a 60 billion euros target will help France achieve its fiscal objectives without compromising the well-being of its citizens.

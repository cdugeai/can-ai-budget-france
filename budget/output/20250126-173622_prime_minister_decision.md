#### Selected Budget Proposal:

The **2025 Budget Proposal - Left-Wing**

#### Reason for Selection:

I chose the left-wing proposal because it achieves a total spending cut of 60 billion euros while introducing measures to reduce wealth inequality through the new wealth tax. The reduction in capital gains tax rates for the middle class will also benefit low- and middle-income households. In contrast, the right-wing proposal's reduced corporate tax rate may lead to increased tax avoidance and decreased government revenue.

#### Rejection of Right-Wing Proposal:

I rejected the right-wing proposal because its total spending cut is greater than the target of 60 billion euros, resulting in a reduction of 0.4 billion euros in essential public services. Furthermore, the reduced corporate tax rate may lead to increased tax avoidance and decreased government revenue.

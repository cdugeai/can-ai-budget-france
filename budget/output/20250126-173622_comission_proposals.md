Total Spending Cuts: -60.5 billion euros

**Changes in Tax Income:**

* Upper Class: The right-wing proposal maintains the existing wealth tax regime but reduces the top marginal rate from 1.5% to 1.2%.
* Middle Class: A reduction in personal income tax rates is proposed, bringing the middle-class tax bracket down from 25% to 22%.
* Business Tax: The minimum corporate tax rate will be reduced from 10% to 8%.

Note that both proposals aim to achieve a total spending cut of 60 billion euros while maintaining essential public services. However, they differ in their approach to achieving this goal and the specific changes proposed for tax income reform.
